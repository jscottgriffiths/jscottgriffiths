- 👋 Hi, I’m @jscottgriffiths
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to code and eventually shifting my career toward more of a technical focus
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTLM, CSS and JavaScriprt
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web design as front-end development seems to be the best place to start learning, however I'm open to collaborate on anything.  I'm also a technical recruiter, so I'm happy to connect with you if you're in the job market.
- 📫 How to reach me - email @ jscottgriffiths@gmail.com
